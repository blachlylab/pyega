pyEGA uses the EGA REST API to download authorized datasets and files
and is an alternaive to the supplied EgaDemoClient.jar

First, store your credentials in ~/.ega.json:
{
    "username": "my.email@university.edu",
    "password": "SuperSecurePasswordIncludes123",
    "key": "symmetric_encryption_key"
}

Your username and password are provided to you by EGA.
The symmetric encryption key can be any non-empty value and
is used to encrypt the data before it is transferred over the wire.
You will still need to decrypt using EgaDemoClient.java


If you know the stable identifier of a dataset (EGAD...) or file (EGAF...)
you can fetch it directly with the "fetch" subcommand. Other commands
to look at specific requests or file details are available.
